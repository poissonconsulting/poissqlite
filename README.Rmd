# poissqlite

An R package to facilitate working with SQLite databases.

## Documentation

### Connection

The `ps_connect_sqlite()` function can be used to connect to an sqlite3 database.
By default it switches foreign keys on.
The connection can be queried using the functions in the `DBI` package (which is automatically loaded).

```{r connect}
library(poissqlite)
dir <- tempdir()
conn <- ps_connect_sqlite(dir = dir, new = TRUE)
print(class(conn))
```

### Working with Blobs

Files and R objects can be added to SQLite databases as storage type [BLOB](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html).

The `ps_blob_file()` function can be used to convert a file to a `blob` while `ps_deblob_file()` performs the inverse operation, i.e., saves a blob to a file of the original format. `ps_blob_files()` and  `ps_deblob_files()` are the equivalent functions for working with multiple files.
In addition, the `ps_blob_object()` and `ps_deblob_object()` can be used to convert between an R object and a blob. This is achieved by reading or writing the object as an `.rds` file which means that `ps_deblob_file()` applied to a blob created using `ps_blob_object()` produces the intermediate `.rds` file.

It's important to realize that the `ps_blob` family of functions embed the original file extension in the raw data to ensure the converted files are the original format. A consequence of this is that when deblobbing, file names should not include an extension (file extensions can be removed using `tools::file_path_sans_ext()`). A second consequence is that the `ps_deblob` family of functions will only work on blobs created using the `ps_blob` functions.

```{r blob}
library(readr)

cars <- tibble::as_tibble(datasets::cars)

print(cars)

write_csv(cars, file.path(dir, "cars.csv"))

blob_tibble <- ps_blob_files(dir, pattern = "[.]csv$")

print(blob_tibble)

dbWriteTable(conn, "blob_table", blob_tibble)

blob_tibble_new <- dbReadTable(conn, "blob_table")

dir_new <- file.path(dir, "new")
dir.create(dir_new)
blobs <- blob_tibble_new$BLOB
names(blobs) <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(blob_tibble_new$File)

ps_deblob_files(blobs, dir = dir_new)

cars_new <- read_csv(file.path(dir_new, "cars.csv"), 
                     col_types = cols(
                       speed = col_double(),
                       dist = col_double()
                     ))

print(cars_new)
```

### Disconnection

```{r disconnect}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```
