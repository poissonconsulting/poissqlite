poissqlite
==========

poissqlite is an R package that facilitates working with SQLite databases.

Installation
------------

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("poissonconsulting/poissqlite")
```

BLOBs
-----

Files can be added to SQLite databases as storage type [BLOB](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html).

The `ps_blob_file()` function can be used to convert a file to a blob (R object of class raw) while `ps_deblob_file()` performs the inverse operation, i.e., saves a blob to a file of the original format. `ps_blob_files()` and `ps_deblob_files()` are the equivalent functions for working with multiple files. In addition, the `ps_blob_object()` and `ps_deblob_object()` can be used to convert between an R object and a blob. This is achieved by reading or writing the object as an `.rds` file which means that `ps_deblob_file()` applied to a blob created using `ps_blob_object()` saves the intermediate `.rds` file.

It's important to realize that the `ps_blob` family of functions embed the original file extension in the raw data to ensure the converted files are the original format. A consequence of this is that when deblobbing, file names should not include an extension (file extensions can be removed using `tools::file_path_sans_ext()`). A second consequence is that the `ps_deblob` family of functions will only work on blobs created using `ps_blob`.

``` r
library(poissqlite)
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
blob <- ps_blob_object(mat)
print(blob)
